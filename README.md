# Advanced Python Pandas

In this week's assginment, we're going to go into more detail on how to manipulate DataFrame, in particular. \
We're going to explore how to reduce and process data using ***GroupBy and Apply***, and how to join data sets from \
multiple files together into one using the ***Merge*** command. The assignment further investigates some features that \
pandas has which are useful for both traditional statistical analyses and machine learning.
